  "fullText": "The morning mist clung to the battlefield like the ghosts of the fallen, and Kael should have been among them. The sword that had pierced his heart still lay beside him, its blade stained with blood that refused to dry. He should have been dead. He remembered the moment clearlyâ€”the sharp pain, the world growing dark, the acceptance of his fate. Yet here he was, breathing, thinking, very much alive.\n\nKael sat up slowly, his hand moving instinctively to his chest where the wound should have been. Nothing. Not even a scar. His armor, torn and bloodied, told the story of a battle that should have ended his life, but his flesh bore no mark of the violence.\n\n'This cannot be,' he whispered to the empty battlefield.\n\nBut as he spoke the words, memories that were not his own began to surface. Images of other battles, other deaths, other awakenings. Each time thinking it was the first, each time discovering it was merely another cycle in an endless chain of existence.\n\nThe truth hit him like a physical blow: he was immortal.\n\nAnd he was not alone.",
  "summary": "Kael awakens on a battlefield where he should have died, discovering his immortal nature and beginning to remember fragments of previous lives and deaths."
